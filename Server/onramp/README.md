# onramp

onramp is a websocket server which allows browsers to connect directly to each other. It acts as an "on-ramp" to a
peer-to-peer network of browsers.

## To use

1. Install Node 0.10+
2. Execute `npm install -g onramp`
3. Execute `onramp`

You can pass `-h [host]` to change set the host of the server. By default it will use "localhost:20500".

onramp currently only serves the localhost and is purpose-built to work with [P](https://github.com/oztu/p).
