# <a href="http://ozan.io/p">P</a> is peer-to-peer networking with browsers

P allows you to establish direct browser-to-browser connections. With P, you can:
* Establish connections to other browsers using a WebSocket server.
* Establish connections to other browsers using connections you've established to other browsers.

After a connection is established the middleman is no longer nescessary â€“ no proxies are involved.

This is made possible by an unstable and young technology -- [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/). 
Currently, only Google Chrome can establish the data channels between browsers that P relies on.

[onramp](https://github.com/oztu/onramp), a simple WebSocket server, is used as the signaling channel 
to establish initial connections.
